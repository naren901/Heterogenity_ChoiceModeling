# Heterogenity_ChoiceModeling
Continuous Heterogeneity modelling in choice modelling:

The consumer  preference for a brand is modeled based on the microeconomic theory of Utility maximization.

The consumer preference for a brand is modeled as a Multinomial Logistic regression models with cusotm Maximum Likelihood estimator function (MLE).
Coefficients for Product Price, Product Display, Product Featuring are estimated.
The estimates are evaluated using Deviation and Significance.

  1) The model would help the price sensitiveness,senstiveness to  Display and Featured for different household segments.
  2) Loyalty parameter is coumpued and used in MLE (Model 2)
  2) Segmentation with in  household are modeled (heterogenity) (Model 3)
  3) Each househould is assumed to be different (continuous heterogenity) and the parameters for each household are assumed to be following a 
  Mulitvariatate Normal distribution (MVN) and the mean and variance of the MVN are estimated.
  
 Kennith Train model is also implemented.
Different MLE function are created to include Loyalty, Segmentation
